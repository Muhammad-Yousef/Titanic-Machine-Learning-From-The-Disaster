# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-The-Disaster
A scikit-learn logistic regression model applied to Kaggle Titanic Dataset.
------------
In this jupyter notebook, I used nothing but a combination of numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for the sake of cleaning data,
performing some exploratory data analysis and using a logistic regressor for predicting the survival of the passengers of Titanic.
